Project is based on glb -> usdz conversion which use [this](https://github.com/google/usd_from_gltf#compatibility) google c++ library under the hood and this project focuses on building the conversion system on top of the AWS Lambda using the [AWS Lambda Container Image Support](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-for-aws-lambda-container-image-support/).


Read [my article](https://towardsaws.com/create-a-docker-container-image-with-custom-lambda-runtime-c1c73944d87e) to get a basic idea about the AWS container image support

### What is glb(or gltf)

glTF is a transmission format for 3D assets that is well suited to the web and mobile devices by removing data that is not important for efficient display of assets. USD is an interchange format that can be used for file editing in Digital Content Creation tools.

## Prerequisites

* AWS account

* EC2 instance:
    * c4 x2large is recommended with 16 GB of storage
    * Install Docker

* Following AWS architecture is used here

![alt text](https://github.com/DasithEdirisinghe/glb2usdz/blob/11a23816cad5be481677774e478c261dcf06623b/img/awsarchi.jpg?raw=true)


   * API Gateway - You can build an API to upload relevant glb files to S3 and send an message to SQS  

   * SQS - When SQS received a message lambda function will be invoked. Following message body is used when sending from the API gateway.

```javascript
    {
        "bucket": "s3bucket",
        "table": "dynamodbtable",
        "s3modelPath": "s3dir/xxxxxxx.glb",
        "s3modelPathUsdz": "s3dir/yyyyyyy.usdz",
        "modelPathUsdz": "cloudfronturl/yyyyyyy.usdz",
        "designId": "zzzzzzzzzzz",
        "userId": "xyzxyzxyz",
        "s3modelPathId": "xxxxxxx"
      }
```

* Lambda handler will do the convertion and upload it in to the S3 and update the dynamoDB entry.

* Converted file initially will be saved in EFS. Then the uploading and updating will take place.

* AWS Endpoints have used to communicate with S3 and dynamoDB in a more secure manner. (No use of internet)


## Using <glb2usdz>

* ssh in to the ec2 instance and configure

* Clone the project

```bash
git clone git@github.com:DasithEdirisinghe/glb2usdz.git
```
  
* project has two main files:

    * Dockerfile:
        * Based on the [this](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/dasithdev/usd-from-gltf) docker image
        * server.lambdaHandler will invoke when the lambda function is triggered

    * server.js

        Do four main use cases:

        * Download a glb file from the S3 bucket
        * Convert it into the usdz format
        * Upload the usdz file to the s3 bucket
        * Update the dynamodb table

* Then CD to the glb2usdz/src directory and follow these steps

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y \
    g++ \
    make \
    cmake \
    unzip \
    libcurl4-openssl-dev

npm install

sudo docker login --username AWS --password $(aws ecr get-login-password --region REGION) xxxxxxxxxxx.dkr.ecr.REGION.amazonaws.com

sudo docker build -t ECR_REPO:tag .

sudo docker tag ECR_REPO:tag xxxxxxxxxxx.dkr.ecr.REGION.amazonaws.com/ECR_REPO:tag

sudo docker push xxxxxxxxxxx.dkr.REGION.amazonaws.com/ECR_REPO:tag
```

* Make sure to change REGION, ECR_REPO as well as the xxxxxxxxxx 

* Then Create a Lambda function using container image
* Deploy the Docker Image you pushed into the ECR_REPO, to the Lambda function
